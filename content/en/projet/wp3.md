## Objectives

**PB3**: How can the Digital Twin enable the optimal utilization of a reconfigurable system's flexibility?

* A reconfigurable system often has the capability for reconfiguration, but it can be challenging to evaluate. The Digital Twin should be a decision support tool for reconfigurability, providing the operator with relevant indicators and a simulation of the consequences of reconfiguration.

**OB3**: Exploit the Digital Twin of a CPS to identify potential reconfigurations and their consequences (in terms of production and energy).

* Foster collaboration between the control engineer's practices (algebraic synthesis, task-based structured analysis) and the production engineer's optimization methods (scheduling/reconfiguration) by integrating digital footprints within Digital Twins.

* Deliberately desynchronize the Digital Twin to analyze the possibilities of CPS reconfiguration through virtual commissioning, prior to decision-making and resynchronization based on the results of WP2.

## Tasks

* Task 3.1: Formalize a set of logical and physical reconfiguration constraints and their interactions.
  * Deliverables D3.1: Formalize a set of reconfiguration constraints for the control engineer and the production engineer, publish in an international conference.

* Task 3.2: Methodology for reconfiguration of control based on logical constraints following changes in specifications imposed by "production".
  * Deliverables D3.2: Methodology for control reconfiguration based on logical constraints, publish in an international journal and thesis committee.

* Task 3.3: Online reconfiguration of a workshop at the logical and physical levels, using the simulation and emulation capabilities of a Digital Twin.
  * Deliverables D3.3: A prototype tool to assist in the reconfiguration of a workshop coupled with a Digital Twin, publish in an international conference.
