## Objectives

**PB1**: How to test and validate a Digital Twin?

By definition, a CPS operates at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Therefore, it is necessary for the Digital Twin, itself defined as a set of models, to also operate in a multi-scale environment.

**OB1**: Propose a methodology for implementing a digital twin that integrates the models and data required by both the automation engineer (at the scale of a controller of a CPS) and the production engineer (at the scale of a line composed of CPS, i.e. SCPP).

* A data-oriented DT architecture will be proposed to manage the different data flows between twins (physical and digital) at each stage of their lifecycle, in connection with existing data standards in this context.

* A study on the interoperability of necessary information systems (ERP/PLM/MES) will be conducted.

## Tasks

* Task 1.1: DT Architecture - State of the art and technical interoperability
  * Deliverable D1.1: State of the art on technical interoperability.
* Task 1.2: Data standards and semantic interoperability
  * Deliverable D1.2: Mapping of standards for technical and semantic interoperability.
* Task 1.3: Architecture and data models for the DT
  * Deliverable D1.3: Proposal of a DT architecture and data model for the other WPs.
