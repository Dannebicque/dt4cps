## Objectives

**PB2**: How to ensure behavioral consistency and temporal synchronization between the Physical Twin and the Digital Twin?

* The DT must exhibit behavior consistent with that of its physical twin. Temporally, an instance of the DT must be synchronized, while other instances of the DT can evolve at different time scales, both in the past and in the future from a chosen moment.

* In a situation where the twins are not aligned, either behaviorally or temporally, questions arise such as: (i) Which twin should be updated? (ii) What actions are required for this update?

**OB2**: Three main study phases:

* Validate the alignment of the twins based on the evaluation of their behavioral consistency and temporal synchronization.

* Before using the DT, initialize it through a calibration phase. It will be necessary to adjust the numerical models of the DT to align its behavior with the Physical Twin.

* When using the DT after observing a misalignment, define corrective actions after identifying the twin to be corrected, whether it is the digital or physical twin.

## Tasks

* Task 2.1: Measurement of an acceptable twin alignment
  * Deliverables D2.1: Definition of twin alignment, establishment of multi-scale, multi-level indicators, publication in a conference.

* Task 2.2: Calibration of the Digital Twin
  * Deliverable D2.2: Process of calibrating a DT.

* Task 2.3: Correction of the twins
  * Deliverable D2.3: Publication in a journal completing WP2.
