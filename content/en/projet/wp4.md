## Objectives

**OB4**: Each of the first three objectives will have its own specific use case for validating the results.

- However, it seems necessary to have a benchmark/demonstrator that incorporates all the results obtained from the DT4CPS project through a final objective.

## Tasks

- Task 4.1: Definition of professions and activity analysis
  - Deliverable D4.1: Analysis, descriptions, and prescriptions on individual and social usage patterns, instruments built in connection with the facets of professions, obstacles, dilemmas, and potentialities related to the Human-Machine system.
- Task 4.2: Definition of use cases in design and operation
  - Deliverable D4.2: Definition of scenarios centered around the platform.
- Task 4.3: POC and demonstrators
  - Deliverables D4.3: POC, demonstrators, and generation and archiving of production data for the scientific community (Benchmark, digital footprints).
- Task 4.4: Design/operation experiments
  - Deliverables D4.4: Protocols, experiments, and analysis of results.
