## S7 Caps (Cellflex-CResTIC)

One of the objectives of the DT4CPS project is to design and experiment with demonstrators with use cases and experimental protocols that test the methodologies and results of WP1 to 3, taking into account the cognitive dimension of the human-machine system.

This objective is defined in WP4 "Use cases, demonstrators and experiments" where it is necessary to (i) understand the transformations of professions and activity of different actors related to the introduction of a digital twin and (ii) propose adaptations of interfaces, training or processes.

For this, we will rely heavily on the CellFlex4.0 platform of the University of Reims Champagne Ardenne, which has a flexible manufacturing workshop, but also a digital twin model of 3D emulator type (NX MCD and Emulate3D). The hardware and software description of the platform is available at: [https://crestic.univ-reims.fr/fr/plateformes/cellflex-4-0](https://crestic.univ-reims.fr/fr/plateformes/cellflex-4-0).

We will find here some deliverables from WP4, particularly those concerning framed scenarios around the platform, but also data from it in Open Access.
